To install software needed, used UV (add link to install). With pyproject.toml and README.md in a directory run uv sync to install all dependencies. uv.lock file will appear. If updating the pyproject.toml to add dependency, can just re-run uv sync and everything will update in the veenv. To run scripts use uv run filename.extension, no need for python3 filename.py or anything, uc does it all.
